BUSINESS-CRITICAL VALIDATION: Memory Pipeline Production TestingBusiness Context
We have a Memory Pipeline that's technically working but not business-validated. Before building more components, we need to prove it can handle real-world conversations with sufficient accuracy for a commercial product.Success Criteria

85% extraction accuracy on real conversations
90% relevant retrieval for context queries
Zero catastrophic failures (mixing users, losing data)
Performance at scale (1000 operations/hour)
